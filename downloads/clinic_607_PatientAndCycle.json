      "Question": "What were the ages of patients who used ART?",
      "QuestionDescription": "The ages of patients who used ART are categorized into four groups: patients younger than age 35, aged 35-37, aged 38-40, and older than age 40. Because a woman's fertility declines with age, ART data are reported separately by age group. You may wish to find a clinic that commonly sees patients your age. The denominator for this measure is the total number of ART cycles. The numerator is the number of cycles that had patients in each age group."

      "QuestionsId": "Q002",
      "Question": "What were the reasons patients used ART?",
      "QuestionDescription": "Displayed below are the percentages of patients' or couples' diagnoses or reasons for using ART. Patients' or couples' diagnoses or reasons for using ART may impact treatment approaches and success rates.  You may wish to find a clinic that commonly performs cycles for patients or couples with similar reasons and diagnoses as yours. The use of these categories may vary by clinic, and the total percentages may be greater than 100% because more than one diagnosis or reason can be reported for each cycle. The denominator for this measure is the total number of ART cycles. The numerator is the total number of cycles within each category."

      "QuestionsId": "Q003",
      "Question": "What was the percentage of cycles in which patients used their own eggs and embryos?",
      "QuestionDescription": "Displayed below are the percentages of all ART cycles in which patients used their own eggs and embryos by patient age. Patient outcomes may differ based on whether they used their own eggs and  embryos, or donor eggs or embryos.  Since patient characteristics are presented per cycle rather than per patient, patients who had more than one ART cycle within the reporting year are represented more than once. The denominator of this measure includes all ART cycles. The numerator is the number of cycles in which patients used their own eggs and  embryos in each age group."

Patient outcomes may differ based on whether they used their own eggs and embryos or donor eggs or embryos. Since patient characteristics are presented per cycle rather than per patient, patients who had more than one ART cycle within the reporting year are represented more than once. The denominator for this measure includes all ART cycles. The numerator is the number of cycles in which patients used donor eggs or embryos in each age group."

      "QuestionDescription": "Displayed below are the percentages of all intended egg retrieval cycles that were discontinued without any eggs retrieved by patient age. A cycle may be discontinued for many reasons, including poor response of a woman's body to medications, illness, or other medical or personal reasons. The denominator for this measure includes all cycles with the expectation to retrieve eggs. The numerator includes all cycles that were discontinued before egg retrieval. "

      "Question": "What percentage of cycles were discontinued after retrieval and before transfer or banking?",
      "QuestionDescription": "Displayed below are the percentages of all cycles that were discontinued after egg retrieval and before egg or embryo transfer or banking by patient age. A cycle may be discontinued after egg retrieval for many reasons, including inability of embryos to develop, illness, or other medical or personal reasons. The denominator for this measure includes all cycles in which eggs were retrieved and all cycles in which previously frozen eggs or embryos were thawed for transfer. The numerator includes all cycles that were discontinued before a transfer or banking occurred."

      "Question": "What was the percentage of cycles discontinued before an egg or embryo was transferred or banked?",
      "QuestionDescription": "Displayed below are the percentages of all cycles that were discontinued before egg or embryo transfer or banking by patient age. All ART cycles start with the intent to transfer eggs or embryos or freeze them for future use. A cycle may be discontinued for many reasons, including poor response of a woman's body to medications, inability of embryos to develop, illness, or other medical or personal reasons. The denominator for this measure includes all cycles started with the intent to transfer or freeze eggs or embryos (i.e., all cycles). The numerator includes all cycles that were discontinued at any time before a transfer or banking occurred. "

      "QuestionDescription": "Displayed below are the percentages of all cycles that were used for fertility preservation by patient age. These cycles were started with the intent to freeze all retrieved eggs or embryos from the patient or a donor for use more than 12 months in the future. The denominator for this measure includes all ART cycles. The numerator is the number of cycles used for fertility preservation."

      "Question": "What percentage of transfers used a gestational carrier?",
      "QuestionDescription": "Displayed below are the percentages of embryo transfers in which the intended parent does not carry the pregnancy but instead uses a gestational carrier. A gestational carrier or surrogate is a woman who gestates, or carries, an embryo that was formed from the egg of another woman with the expectation of returning  the infant to its intended parents. Some states do not permit clinics to offer this service. The denominator includes all cycles in which at least one embryo was transferred. The numerator includes the total number of transfers in which the pregnancy carrier was a gestational carrier."

      "Question": "What percentage of transfers used frozen embryos?",
      "QuestionDescription": "Displayed below are the percentages of embryo transfers in which at least one frozen embryo created from either fresh or frozen eggs was transferred.  Embryos can be frozen and transferred at a later time after thawing. The denominator includes all cycles in which at least one embryo was transferred. The numerator includes all transfers with at least one frozen embryo.  "

      "Question": "What percentage of transfers used intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)?",
      "QuestionDescription": "Displayed below are the percentages of embryo transfers in which at least one embryo was fertilized using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). ICSI is a procedure in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg for fertilization, typically to overcome male factor infertility. It is an alternative to conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF), in which sperm compete to fertilize an egg. Transferred embryos may be fresh or previously frozen. The denominator includes all cycles in which at least one embryo was transferred. The numerator includes all transfers in which ICSI was performed."

PGT is used to detect chromosomal or genetic abnormalities and prevent the transmission of inherited diseases. The denominator includes all cycles in which at least one embryo was transferred. The numerator includes all transfers in which PGT was performed."

      "QuestionDescription": "Displayed below are the percentages of embryo transfers that used a single embryo. The best outcome of ART is the birth of a healthy infant. For most patients, this outcome can be achieved when a single embryo is selected for transfer, regardless of the number of embryos available. The denominator includes all cycles in which at least one embryo was transferred. The numerator includes the number of transfers in which only one embryo was transferred."
