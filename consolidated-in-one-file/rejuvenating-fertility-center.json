        "QuestionDescription": "Displayed below are the cumulative percentages of cycles started in the previous year with the intent to retrieve eggs that resulted in a live-birth delivery. Not all cycles started with the intent to retrieve eggs result in actual egg retrieval; some cycles may be canceled before the egg retrieval is performed for many reasons. Therefore, the number of intended retrievals may be higher than the number of actual retrievals. A live-birth delivery is the delivery of one or more infants with at least one born alive. The denominator for this measure includes the number of intended retrievals. The numerator includes the number of live-birth deliveries that have resulted from the intended retrievals and associated transfers within 12 months of cycle start. For example, if a clinic started 60 intended egg retrievals, and these resulted in 30 live-birth deliveries, the average live-birth delivery rate for intended retrievals would be 30 (live-birth deliveries) \u00f7 60 (intended retrievals) = 0.5, or 50.0% of intended retrievals resulting in a live-birth delivery.

The denominator for this measure includes the number of new patients.

Actual egg retrieval is an ART cycle in which at least one egg was retrieved from the patient. A live-birth delivery is the delivery of one or more infants with at least one born alive. The cumulative (or combined) chance of a live-birth delivery typically increases with each additional embryo transfer because it provides another opportunity to conceive a child. The denominator for this measure includes the number of actual retrievals. The numerator includes the live-birth deliveries that resulted from the retrievals and associated transfers within 12 months of cycle start in each age group. For example, if a clinic started 60 intended retrievals, and 55 of these intended retrieval cycles progressed to the egg retrieval stage, which resulted in 30 live-birth deliveries, the average live-birth delivery rate per actual egg retrieval would be 30 (live-birth deliveries) \u00f7 55 (actual retrievals) = 0.545, or 54.5% of actual retrievals resulting in a live-birth delivery."
